<h1>A hammocking social network</h1>

I'm starting to get tired of watching all of my friends spamming my instagram-feed with hammocking pictures (not gonna lie norwegian nature is beautiful tho). I have decided to build an app that lets people post their favourite hammocking spots and tag them on a map, as well as letting people that visited the spots the positibility to rate them. 

Posts can be sorted by highest rating, or nearest spot. 

I plan on building the app in react, using firebase for user and data management. 

Check out <a href="https://www.notion.so/Hengek-ye-2f9350232d6f40f0b71a0cbe7d3f1c70">this link</a> to see the progress on the project (in norwegian), and read on down below for the devlog.
